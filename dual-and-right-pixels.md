# Dual & Right Pixels

### Dual Pixels

The dual pixel sits at the heart of the isometric grid. It encapsulates the 2-1 proportion inherent to isometric pixel art.

### Right Pixels

Right Pixels are the pixels on the right side of dual pixels. They serve as anchors for positioning, and for drawing lines.

> Tipp: If you draw lines, always try to start and end on Right Pixels. If you're consistent, lines will be cleaner and everything will be more in sync.
