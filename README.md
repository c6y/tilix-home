# TiliX

A modular system for isometric pixel blocks.

The aim of TiliX is to define a set of pixel art rules, that enforce consistency, and help contributors to work together. The system also hopes to establish a base for generative approaches and automated workflows.

Grid dimensions have been carefully chosen for TiliX, and allow for flexible divisions. Additionally, the concepts of  'Dual Pixels' and  'Right Pixels' are introduced. These are aimed to avoid clusters of lines.

> Note: If you need to flip objects horizontally, TiliX is not for you, as objects feature unique left and right side properties.
